Csgrouper was made on Linux Debian. It is compatible with Unix-like systems.



*** How to install Csgrouper?

Once the required module and third party software are installed, the best thing
to do is to unpack the tar file on top of the home directory, make it writable 
to leave it there for the first trials of the software. Once everything will be 
up and running it will be possible to install elsewhere by changing paths from 
the GUI (and probably also correcting some configuration files by hand [1]). 
These are the kind of things that haven't been worked out a lot while programming.



*** Required Cpan modules and third party software:


--- Third party:

	Csound  : a package from standard distribution will do.
	Xterm   : located in /usr/bin (didn't optionalize this yet).


--- Cpan Modules:

	Cwd 
	Data::Dumper 
	Modern::Perl 
	Moose 
	namespace::autoclean 
	Pod::Simple 
	POSIX 
	Scalar::Util 
	Tk 
	XML::Simple

*** Notes:

[1] Typically the 'use lib ("$ENV{HOME}/Csgrouper/lib");' code line in csgrouper.pl 
will have to be corrected manually when changing the software from standard location, 
as well as the 'our 	$INSTALLDIR = $ENV{HOME};' in Csgrouper.pm. 

[2] Csgrouper can run into problem due to a specificity in Github that destroys 
unused folders (like Csgrouper/run/bkp) when their presence is required for the
application to play a score.
