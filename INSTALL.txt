Csgrouper was  created on Debian Linux. It is compatible with Unix-like systems.

*** Installing Csgrouper

Once the required modules and third party software are installed, it's easiest 
to unpack the Csgrouper.tar.gz file in your home directory, make sure the 
Csgrouper directory is writable, and leave it there while you try it out. Once 
everything is up and running, it's possible to move it elsewhere by changing paths
via the GUI. You'll probably also need to correct some configuration files by 
hand [1]; there are a few things that haven't quite been worked out completely yet.


*** Required CPAN modules and third party software:


--- Third party:

	Csound  : any standard distribution will do.
	Xterm   : assumed to be located in /usr/bin; this isn't a modifiable option yet.

--- CPAN Modules:

	Cwd 
	Data::Dumper 
	Modern::Perl 
	Moose 
	namespace::autoclean 
	Pod::Simple 
	POSIX 
	Scalar::Util 
	Tk 
	XML::Simple 
	
See the MANIFEST file for all the files and directories expected.

	
*** Notes:

[1] At the moment, the 'use lib ("$ENV{HOME}/Csgrouper/lib");' line in csgrouper.pl 
will have to be updated manually when moving the software from to a new location; 
the 'our $INSTALLDIR = $ENV{HOME};' in Csgrouper.pm will need to be fixed as well..
